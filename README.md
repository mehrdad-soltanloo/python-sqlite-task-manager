## Project Overview

This is a simple **Task Manager** application built using **Python** and **SQLite**. The application allows you to perform the basic CRUD operations:

- **Create**: Add new tasks.
- **Read**: View all tasks.
- **Update**: Update existing tasks.
- **Delete**: Delete tasks.

The project uses SQLite as a database to store tasks, and all interactions are done via the command line interface (CLI).

## Features

- Add new tasks with a title and description.
- View all tasks in the database.
- Update a task's title, description, and status.
- Delete tasks by their ID.
- A simple command-line interface for user interaction.

## Technologies Used

- **Python** (version 3.7+)
- **SQLite** (Python `sqlite3` module)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.7 or higher installed on your local machine.
- Basic knowledge of Python and SQL.

## Project Setup

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/task-manager-sqlite.git
```

2. Navigate to the project folder.

```bash
cd task-manager-sqlite
```

3. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

## How to Run the Project

1. Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed and your virtual environment activated (if using one).

2. Run the Python script.

```bash
python task_manager.py
```

3. Follow the command-line prompts to add, view, update, or delete tasks.

## Code Explanation

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the major components of the project:

1. Database Connection
   The project connects to an SQLite database using the sqlite3 module. The connect() function creates a connection to a database file named tasks.db. If the file doesnâ€™t exist, SQLite will create it.

```bash
import sqlite3

def connect():
    return sqlite3.connect('tasks.db')
```

2. Creating the Tasks Table
   The create_table() function ensures that the tasks table is created when the project starts. If the table doesnâ€™t exist, it is created with columns for id, title, description, and status.

```bash
def create_table():
    conn = connect()
    try:
        cur = conn.cursor()
        cur.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS tasks (
                        id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
                        title TEXT NOT NULL,
                        description TEXT,
                        status TEXT DEFAULT 'Pending'
                    )''')
        conn.commit()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error creating table: {e}")
    finally:
        conn.close()
```

3. Adding Tasks
   The add_task() function allows you to add new tasks to the database. Each task has a title and an optional description. The status is set to 'Pending' by default.

```bash
def add_task(title, description):
    conn = connect()
    try:
        cur = conn.cursor()
        cur.execute("INSERT INTO tasks (title, description) VALUES (?, ?)", (title, description))
        conn.commit()
        print("Task added successfully!")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error adding task: {e}")
    finally:
        conn.close()
```

4. Viewing Tasks
   The view_tasks() function retrieves all tasks from the database and prints them in a readable format. It fetches all rows from the tasks table using cur.fetchall()

```bash
def view_tasks():
    conn = connect()
    try:
        cur = conn.cursor()
        cur.execute("SELECT * FROM tasks")
        rows = cur.fetchall()
        for row in rows:
            print(f"ID: {row[0]}, Title: {row[1]}, Description: {row[2]}, Status: {row[3]}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error fetching tasks: {e}")
    finally:
        conn.close()
```

5. Updating Tasks
   The update_task() function allows you to update an existing task's title, description, or status. It builds the update query dynamically based on which fields are provided.

```bash
def update_task(task_id, title=None, description=None, status=None):
    conn = connect()
    try:
        cur = conn.cursor()
        updates = []
        params = []

        if title:
            updates.append("title = ?")
            params.append(title)
        if description:
            updates.append("description = ?")
            params.append(description)
        if status:
            updates.append("status = ?")
            params.append(status)

        if not updates:
            print("No fields provided to update.")
            return

        query = f"UPDATE tasks SET {', '.join(updates)} WHERE id = ?"
        params.append(task_id)

        cur.execute(query, params)
        conn.commit()
        print("Task updated successfully!")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error updating task: {e}")
    finally:
        conn.close()

```

6. Deleting Tasks
   The delete_task() function deletes a task based on its ID. It uses the DELETE SQL statement and removes the specified task from the database.

```bash
def delete_task(task_id):
    conn = connect()
    try:
        cur = conn.cursor()
        cur.execute("DELETE FROM tasks WHERE id = ?", (task_id,))
        conn.commit()
        print("Task deleted successfully!")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error deleting task: {e}")
    finally:
        conn.close()

```

7. Command-Line Interface (CLI)
   The main() function serves as the command-line interface. It presents the user with options to add, view, update, or delete tasks. Based on the user's input, the corresponding function is called.

```bash
def main():
    while True:
        print("\nTask Manager")
        print("1. Add Task")
        print("2. View Tasks")
        print("3. Update Task")
        print("4. Delete Task")
        print("5. Exit")
        choice = input("Enter your choice: ")

        if choice == '1':
            title = input("Enter task title: ")
            description = input("Enter task description: ")
            add_task(title, description)
        elif choice == '2':
            view_tasks()
        elif choice == '3':
            task_id = int(input("Enter task ID to update: "))
            title = input("Enter new title (leave blank to skip): ")
            description = input("Enter new description (leave blank to skip): ")
            status = input("Enter new status (leave blank to skip): ")
            update_task(task_id, title or None, description or None, status or None)
        elif choice == '4':
            task_id = int(input("Enter task ID to delete: "))
            delete_task(task_id)
        elif choice == '5':
            break
        else:
            print("Invalid choice. Please try again.")

```

## Future Improvements

- Add a user authentication system to manage tasks for multiple users.
- Create a GUI using a framework like Tkinter or PyQt.
- Allow task prioritization and deadlines.
- Implement filtering and sorting options for tasks.
